\section{Scope}
This covers access to the facilities used at UNL to manufacture modules.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Purpose}
Raw parts and finished modules need special protection, including storage. This document describes how parts are stored safely.

    \toprule
Objects & Production stage & Storage rules \\
    \midrule
BBM & Delivery & Containers (GelPaks) remain closed outside the cleanroom. Transfer to cleanroom as soon as feasible. \\
    & Until manufacturing & Store in cabinet inside cleanroom in labelled area. Keep containers closed until used. \\
    \midrule
HDI & Delivery & Containers (ESD boxes) remain closed outside the cleanroom. Transfer to cleanroom as soon as feasible. \\
    & Until manufacturing & Store in cabinet inside cleanroom in labelled area. Keep containers closed until used. \\
    \midrule
Module & Glued, wirebonded but not yet encapsulated & Store on chucks or mounted on module carriers (depending on following steps) in cabinet inside cleanroom in labelled area. \\
       & Encapsulated, mounted on module carrier & Store in cabinet inside cleanroom in labelled area. Module may leave cleanroom for testing and shipping. Kapton-insulated binder clip needs to be attached for handling if ESD-protection is temporarily unavailabl (e.g.~transferring modules from cleanroom to teststand). \\
