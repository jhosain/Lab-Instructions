## FAQ

  - How do I access the elog?
  
  > The elog is hosted on the UNL Tier 3 server and can be accessed at https://t3.unl.edu:8175/Phase_II/. The elog contains a self-signed security certificate so you will likely need to grant a security exception in your browser. If you need an account on the elog, contact Caleb Fangmeier to get one.
  
  - How do I purchase things for the lab?
  
  > You must fill out and submit a [requisition form](https://www.unl.edu/physics/docs/Requisition2014.pdf). You can get the appropriate cost object from supervising faculty. They must also review and approve all requisitions before submission. After submitting a requisition, **add a copy of a requisition to the [Phase 2 Requisitions repository](https://github.com/nebraska-silicon-lab/Phase_II_Requisitions)**.

  > When your order arrives, you should receive an email letting you know. Retrieve it from the package room which you can access through the buisiness office. Then unpack and inspect the package. If everything looks ok, sign the packaging slip and return it to the buisiness office. Avoid accumulating an excess of packaging material in the lab. There is a cardboard recycling dumpster on the south side of the building. Finally, be sure to submit an elog to record that the item has been received.
