## FAQ

  - How do I access the elog?
  
  > The elog is hosted on the UNL Tier 3 server and can be accessed at https://t3.unl.edu:8175/Phase_II/. The elog contains a self-signed security certificate so you will likely need to grant a security exception in your browser. If you need an account on the elog, contact Caleb Fangmeier to get one.
  
  - How do I purchase things for the lab?
  
  > You must fill out and submit a [requisition form](https://www.unl.edu/physics/docs/Requisition2014.pdf). You can get the appropriate cost object from supervising faculty. They must also review and approve all requisitions before submission. After submitting a requisition, **add a copy of a requisition to the [Phase 2 Requisitions repository](https://github.com/nebraska-silicon-lab/Phase_II_Requisitions)**.
