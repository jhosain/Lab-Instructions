**If you are using the HEP lab JH 174, including the clean and general area, during the period of the COVID-19 related restrictions, please review the guidelines below.**

 - Do not come to the lab if the work you plan can be done from home
 
 - Face masks must be worn at all times in the lab. There are disposable masks provided in the lab, but personal cloth or disposable masks are also acceptable.

 - Practice social distancing if you are not alone in the lab

 - To access the lab, first request access to the [scheduling google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=ZzdmOXBiYzNpNjg2amo0bjFnMjY0Y25qMmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) from Frank. Next, create an "event" indicating when you will be in the lab. Try to avoid overlapping with others unless you need to be working simultaneously on a project.

 - After you are done with your work, use a disinfectant spray with wipes to clean the surfaces you touched including the bench top, tools, keyboard, your custom-made equipment, your chair. Wiping the door handles and light switches is good too. You can also do a similar procedure when you come in. The spray/supplies will be provided.

 - **Due to shortages of cleaning and disinfecting supplies, there may not be wipes, soap, or disinfecting spray in the lab. In this case, you can still reduce your exposure by limiting what you touch, especially your face, and washing your hands thoroughly in the restroom after completing lab work.**

  - When you come into the lab, wash hands with a disinfecting soap that will be provided next to the sink. Do it also if you stepped out of the lab for whatever reason and coming back.

  - Wear disposable thin gloves, especially for the work in the clean room, but also in the general area if you can (the gloves are available). Do not reuse them. When wearing them, do not touch your face or other exposed body parts (and same advice stands without the gloves, of course).

   - Whatever garbage you generate, please dispose it yourself. The trash cans in the room possibly wonâ€™t be emptied by the janitorial service.

   - If you feel you are even slightly sick, whether your symptoms match COVID-19 or not, just do not come to the lab. If there is urgent work to do, discuss with your faculty supervisor first (prof. Golf or Kravchenko).

   - If you need to work in a group with one or more colleagues in close proximity, discuss with your supervisor first.
   
   - If you notice the supply of any PPE is low, inform your supervisor who will then have replacements ordered.
   


If you have questions, please do ask. We will update the SOPs in the printed form in JH 174 and online shortly.
