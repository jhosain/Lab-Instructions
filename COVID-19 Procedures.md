**If you are using the HEP lab JH 174, including the clean and general area, during the period of the COVID-19 related restrictions, please review the guidelines below.**

 - Do not come to the lab if the work you plan can be done from home

 - Practice social distancing if you are not alone in the lab

 - If you are a student or a postdoc, inform your supervisor (Frank Golf, Ilya Kravchenko) when you plan to be in the lab and in which part

 - After you are done with your work, use a disinfectant spray with wipes to clean the surfaces you touched including the bench top, tools, keyboard, your custom-made equipment, your chair. Wiping the door handles is good too. You can also do a similar procedure when you come in. The spray/supplies will be provided.

 - **Due to shortages of cleaning and disinfecting supplies, there may not be wipes, soap, or disinfecting spray in the lab. In this case, you can still reduce your exposure by limiting what you touch, especially your face, and washing your hands thoroughly in the restroom after completing lab work.**

  - When you come into the lab, wash hands with a disinfecting soap that will be provided next to the sink. Do it also if you stepped out of the lab for whatever reason and coming back.

  - Wear disposable thin gloves, especially for the work in the clean room, but also in the general area if you can (the gloves are available). Do not reuse them. When wearing them, do not touch your face or other exposed body parts (and same advice stands without the gloves, of course).

   - Whatever garbage you generate, please dispose it yourself. The trash cans in the room possibly wonâ€™t be emptied by the janitorial service.

   - If you feel you are even slightly sick, whether your symptoms match COVID-19 or not, just do not come to the lab. If there is urgent work to do, discuss with your faculty supervisor first (prof. Golf or Kravchenko).

   - If you need to work in a group with one or more colleagues in close proximity, discuss with your supervisor first.
   


If you have questions, please do ask. We will update the SOPs in the printed form in JH 174 and online shortly.
